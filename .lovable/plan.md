## Trinity Landing Page — Redesign Plan

### Design Direction
Warm editorial foundation with a modern SaaS/AI edge. Replace serif typography (Instrument Serif) with a clean geometric sans-serif like **Inter** or **Space Grotesk** for headings, keeping DM Sans for body text. Maintain the warm cream/terracotta palette but sharpen it with crisper borders, subtle shadows, and more whitespace.

### What's Being Built
A full React conversion of the existing Trinity landing page HTML into clean, component-based code with the following sections — all content preserved as-is:

1. **Sticky Navigation** — frosted-glass navbar with logo, nav links, and CTA button
2. **Hero Section** — large heading, subtext, and dual CTA buttons with stronger vertical spacing
3. **Logo Bar** — trusted-by strip with company names
4. **How It Works** — 4-step cards in a grid
5. **The Difference (Differentiator)** — split layout with text on left and animated trait sliders on right
6. **Use Cases** — 6 cards in a responsive grid with hover effects
7. **Multi-Persona Demo** — tabbed demo that switches between 3 persona responses on click
8. **Testimonials** — card grid with quotes and author info
9. **Pricing** — 3-tier pricing cards with featured highlight
10. **FAQ** — accordion-style expandable questions
11. **Final CTA** — dark section with call-to-action
12. **Footer** — simple footer with links

### Key Design Enhancements
- **Typography swap**: Replace Instrument Serif with a modern geometric sans-serif (Space Grotesk) for all headings — gives an AI/SaaS feel while keeping warmth
- **Stronger spacing**: More generous padding between sections (8-10rem instead of 6rem), more breathing room in cards
- **Trait slider animations**: The personality bars in the differentiator section animate their fill widths on scroll into view
- **Interactive demo tabs**: Clicking persona tabs in the multi-persona section actually switches the displayed response content
- **Refined cards**: Subtle box shadows, slightly larger border radius, cleaner hover states
- **Better visual hierarchy**: Larger section labels, more contrast between heading and body text sizes, bolder accent color usage
- **Crisper borders and surfaces**: Slightly more defined card edges, subtle elevation on hover

### No Backend Needed
This is a purely frontend landing page — no database, auth, or API integration required.
